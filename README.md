# Let's keep it Short And Simple
# Introduction To Natural Language Processing
As we all know that to feed the text to your model (Neural Network, ML Models) we need to convert the text to numbers.
# 1. Step - 1: Preparing text for NLP
In this colab, 
1. You will how to prepare the text for the Natural Language Processing task
2. We will start working with simple data such as random sentences.
3. You will be guided -
        1. How to convert text to numbers (process known as tokenization)
        2. How to convert text to sequences (converting text to numbers as it in order of original sentence so as to keep the meaning)
        3. How to deal with words not present in the sentences
        4. How to deal with different length sentences (making all sentences to the same length)
# 2. Step - 1.1: Dealing with Real-World Dataset
In this colab,
1. You will known how to download and load dataset.
2. How to convert whole dataset in numbers
3. Apply truncating, padding and 'not in vocabulary' preprocessing methods

# 3. NLP-Visualization with Word Embedding and Basic Sentimental Model
In this colab,
1. You will known how to download and load dataset
2. How to convert dataset into numbers 
3. Preprocess the dataset
4. Preparing the model 
5. Building A Basic Sentimental Model
6. Visualizaing the result with Tensorflow Embedding Projector.
7. This Colab will be a full Introduction to Natural Language Processing.
